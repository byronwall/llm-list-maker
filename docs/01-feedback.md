It's not working. The JSON is too limited. The descriptions are not rich enough. Not enough detail in responses.

Will need to really think about the goals here: depth vs. feature listing vs. something else?

The base model is surely no good for the task: need to jump to GPT-5 before going farther.

UX is terrible and we're nowhere near the quality of ChatGPT content.

Those issues aside, the stack is holding up. UI looks good and Cursor is not having any issues with the code.
